          <p>Our journey began with one humble shop in Fort, Mumbai and grew to over one thousand locations throughout
            India under the inspiring vision of our founder, Hussein Khorakiwala in the early 1956. Since then, our
            family has combined their years of experience with the vision of a community of collaborative shop owners,
            suppliers and other partners working together to create a brand name in the market to grow their business to
            what it is today.</p>
          <p>
            In order to achieve this, the family offers franchises to budding entrepreneurs & distributors partnering
            with them to ensure success and excellence.
